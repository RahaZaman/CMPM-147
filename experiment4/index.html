				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project creates interactive infinite worlds using procedural generation techniques and user interaction. It consists of three generators: Grassy, Ocean/Sea, and Desert/Sandy, each offering unique environments with infinite extension. The Grassy generator generates terrain with variations in grass and flowers, allowing users to dynamically plant flowers. The Ocean/Sea generator simulates an endless expanse of water with variations in sea life, enabling users to spawn fish. The Desert/Sandy generator creates an infinite desert landscape with scattered cacti, allowing users to plant cacti. Each generator employs a world key to customize variations, ensuring dynamic responses to user input.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The project utilizes JavaScript along with the p5.js library for creating three different infinite world generators: Grassy, Ocean/Sea, and Desert/Sandy. Each generator employs procedural generation techniques, utilizing noise functions for terrain generation and XXH hashing for world seed generation. The generators feature interactive elements, allowing users to click on tiles to trigger dynamic visual effects such as flowers in the grassy world, fish in the ocean world, and cacti in the desert world. Navigation within the infinite worlds is facilitated by keyboard controls, enabling users to scroll through the environments using arrow keys or the WASD keys. Overall, the project combines JavaScript, p5.js, procedural generation, interactive elements, and keyboard controls to create immersive and dynamic infinite worlds.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Having completed this project to the best of my ability, I've gained valuable insights into procedural generation techniques for creating infinite worlds. Through the utilization of  the p5.js library, along with procedural generation techniques such as noise functions and XXH hashing, and more. I've developed a deeper understanding of how to generate infinite worlds as well as better grasp of the tools and technologies that are used to create them. While there is room for improvement, I am confident in the effort I've invested in terms of creativity, design, code, and style. Despite the challenges encountered, I am proud of the work I've accomplished within the allocated time frame.</p>
