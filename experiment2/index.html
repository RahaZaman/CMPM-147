				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project is a generative landscape scene inspired by a beautiful mountain landscape with a river and forest. The scene consists of mountains, a flowing river, grass, and trees rendered using p5.js primitives. By adjusting parameters such as colors, shapes, and sizes, the scene creates a dynamic and lifelike impression of nature.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>
				<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/92b08c65-1e6d-4cb6-b25b-2a10fdb98a01/Mountain%20Landscape%20with%20River%20and%20Forest.jpg?v=1713256975422" alt="Inspiring Image" />
				<p>Relation to inspiring image:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Color:</strong> The sky, grass, river, mountain, and trees were all taken from the inspiring image.</li>
				  <li><strong>Primitives:</strong> Trees are rendered using the 'triangle' primitives, and the river is rendered using the 'rectangle' primitives.</li>
				  <li><strong>Polygons:</strong> The mountains in the background are represented with polygon 'vertex' cells.</li>
				  <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Different seed values lead to unique mountain shapes and randomly positioned trees as well as the river.</li>
				  <li><strong>Life:</strong> The shapes of the mountains, and the positioning of the trees and river create an impression that there's motion and movement.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The project utilizes the p5.js library to create interactive and dynamic graphics. It employs functions like rect and vertex to draw primitive shapes such as rectangles for the river and polygons for the mountains. Randomization techniques and user interaction are incorporated to add variability and interactivity to the scene. Additionally, HTML and CSS are used to display the project on a webpage and integrate it with other elements.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Reflecting on the project, I believe there was room for more creativity in exploring different variations of landscapes and experimenting with additional features like animation or interactive elements. However, I feel satisfied with the outcome as I put my best effort into completing the project within the given constraints. Throughout the process, I encountered challenges in understanding and effectively utilizing the p5.js library, particularly in implementing complex shapes and interactions. Despite these barriers, I persevered and learned valuable lessons that will inform my future projects.</p>
