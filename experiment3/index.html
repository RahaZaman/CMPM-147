				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This page contains two projects. One project showcases an Overworld Map, dynamically generating biomes like grass and trees using Perlin noise, with moving clouds adding to its lifelike charm. The other project features a Dungeon Room generator, utilizing autotiling to construct randomized room layouts, delineating borders and interior tiles for an immersive dungeon experience. Both projects demonstrate the creative application of grid-based generation techniques in interactive environments.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The Dungeon Room and Overworld Map projects both leverage autotiling logic and grid-based generation to create immersive environments. In the Dungeon Room project, a randomized dungeon room is generated within the grid, with borders marked using autotiling. Each cell within the room is meticulously filled, utilizing a combination of symbols to distinguish between borders and room tiles. On the other hand, the Overworld Map project utilizes Perlin noise to generate biomes, with autotiling seamlessly transitioning between different terrain types. Additionally, dynamic elements such as moving clouds add a sense of life and dynamism to the overworld landscape. Overall, both projects showcase the versatility of grid-based generation and autotiling in creating interactive and visually appealing environments.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Having completed this project to the best of my ability I've learned much about procedural generation in terms of worlds and terrains. By utilizing grids, auto tiling, p5.js functions, and more I was able to get a good understanding of how terrains and worlds are generated. I believe that I completed the assignment well, and put in a good amount of effort in terms of creativity, design, code, and style. My work could've been a little bit better but for the amount of time spent on the project, I am confident and proud of the work that I did.</p>
